This repository is a **UI system starter template** for building consistent, scalable front-end experiences using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

---

## What This Template Is

This template is designed to be:

- A fast starting point for new projects
- A shared foundation for teams
- A reliable source of context for AI-assisted coding tools
- Framework-agnostic and long-lived

This is **not** a finished website or app.  
It is a **baseline system** that can be used across many types of projects.

---

## What This Template Is For

This template is ideal for:

- Marketing websites
- Editorial and content-led sites
- Design systems and style guides
- Webflow exports or hand-coded sites
- Front-end foundations for larger apps
- Prototypes that may later evolve into products

It provides:

- A complete **design system** (tokens, layout, typography, utilities)
- Clear **layout and spacing rules**
- Reusable **UI patterns**
- Consistent **CSS architecture**
- Documented **best practices** for usage

---

## What This Template Is NOT

This template intentionally does **not**:

- Define application architecture (state, routing, data)
- Enforce a JavaScript framework (React, Next, Vue, etc.)
- Include backend logic or APIs
- Solve product-specific business logic

Those concerns belong **above** this layer.

---

## How This Template Works

This template works in:

- Vanilla HTML / CSS / JS projects
- React and Next.js applications
- Node-powered frontends
- Design system libraries
- Component-driven architectures

**Key Principle:** HTML, CSS, and design rules do not disappear in advanced stacks — they are rendered by them. In frameworks, components *consume* this system rather than replace it.

---

## How to Use This Template

1. Clone the repository
2. Follow the [Setup guide](setup.html) to customize brand tokens, fonts, and logo
3. Use the style guide to understand available patterns
4. Build pages using the documented layout structure
5. Add project-specific logic on top

You should be able to start building **immediately** without reorganising the system.

---

## Guiding Rule

If you're unsure where something belongs, ask:

> "Is this a **UI rule** or an **application concern**?"

- UI rules belong **here**
- Application concerns belong **outside this template**

---

## Why This Exists

This template exists to:

- Reduce setup time
- Eliminate inconsistency
- Prevent reinvention
- Improve collaboration
- Scale from simple sites to complex products

It is meant to evolve — but always from a **clear, shared foundation**.
