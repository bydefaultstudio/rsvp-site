title: "Markdown"
subtitle: "Styling guidelines for markdown content"
description: "Documentation for markdown styling and design system integration"
section: "Content"
order: 10
---

This guide defines the consistent formatting standards for all documentation pages in the ByDefault project.

## Overview

All markdown files should follow these standardized patterns to ensure:

- **Consistent visual hierarchy** - Clear heading structure and spacing
- **Readable content** - Proper list formatting and code block styling
- **Maintainable structure** - Standardized dividers and organization
- **Professional appearance** - Clean, modern documentation styling

---

## Frontmatter

Every markdown file in the documentation must start with frontmatter (YAML metadata) that defines the page's metadata and organization:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Documentation Title Here"
subtitle: "Your page subtitle or brief description"
description: "Guide defining how to structure and organize your content"
section: "overview"
order: 1
---

Your markdown content starts here...
```

**Note:** The frontmatter must be at the very top of the file, enclosed by `---` on separate lines.

### Required Fields

- **`title`** - The main page title (used in `<h1>` and page `<title>`)
- **`subtitle`** - Optional subtitle displayed below the title
- **`description`** - Meta description for SEO and social sharing
- **`section`** - Section name for navigation grouping (e.g., `"overview"`, `"features"`, `"api"`)
- **`order`** - Numeric order within the section (lower numbers appear first)

### Example


---

## Headers

# Your Primary Headline, Big, Bold, and Unmissable

## Supporting Headline to Guide Your Content

### Section Headings to Keep Content Organised

#### Smaller Subheading for Detailed Content Organisation

##### Compelling Statement That Captures Attention Instantly

###### Clear Navigation Heading for Important Information

```markdown
# Your Primary Headline, Big, Bold, and Unmissable

### Section Headings to Keep Content Organised

#### Smaller Subheading for Detailed Content Organisation

##### Compelling Statement That Captures Attention Instantly

###### Clear Navigation Heading for Important Information
```

## Emphasis

This paragraph demonstrates how body text will look across your layout. **Bold text** adds emphasis, while *italics* offer a subtle highlight. You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ to show edits. Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_** for clarity.

## Lists

Typography principles for effective design:

1. **Readability** - Use clear, legible typefaces
2. **Hierarchy** - Establish visual order with size and weight
   * Larger sizes for headings
   * Medium sizes for subheadings
   * Standard sizes for body text
1. **Spacing** - Create breathing room between elements
   1. Letter spacing for clarity
   2. Line height for readability
   3. Paragraph spacing for flow
4. **Consistency** - Maintain uniform styling throughout

   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. This extended paragraph serves to demonstrate how substantial blocks of text will behave across your layout, giving you a realistic sense of how readers will experience longer-form content.

   To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.  
   This maintains readability while keeping content compact.  
   (This is particularly useful for documentation where precision matters.)

* Unordered lists can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

The ByDefault design system uses `CSS custom properties` for all design tokens. Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it for clarity.

```css
:root {
  /* Typography tokens */
  --font-primary: "Arial", sans-serif;
  --font-s: 16px;
  --line-height-l: 1.4;
  
  /* Color tokens */
  --text-plain: var(--black);
  --text-link: var(--brand-accent);
  --background-plain: var(--white);
}
```

```javascript
// Design system token usage
const designTokens = {
  spacing: {
    xs: 'var(--space-xs)',
    s: 'var(--space-s)',
    m: 'var(--space-m)'
  },
  colors: {
    primary: 'var(--text-primary)',
    accent: 'var(--text-link)'
  }
};
```

```

## Blockquotes

> Words matter, but how those words are presented matters just as much. Typography transforms content from mundane to magical, from ordinary to extraordinary.

> Typography is more than style; it's about communication. The right type makes content readable, relatable, and engaging, drawing readers into the heart of the message.

> The details are not the details. They make the design. — Charles Eames

## Line Breaks

This paragraph demonstrates how body text will look across your layout. **Bold text** adds emphasis, while *italics* offer a subtle highlight.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
