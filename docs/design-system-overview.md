## What Is a Design System?

A **Design System** is your team's shared toolkit for creating **consistent, high‑quality digital products and brand experiences**.

Think of it as a **well‑organised box of Lego bricks,** but instead of plastic pieces, you get reusable components, brand assets, design rules, and clear guidelines.

It serves as a **single source of truth** for both **product teams and brand guardians**, so no one wastes time reinventing elements or guessing which visual style to use.

Whether you're designing an app screen, a marketing campaign, or a customer touchpoint, the Design System ensures everything looks, feels, and behaves like it comes from the same brand.

## What's Inside a Design System?

- **Design tokens** – Core values like color palettes, spacing, typography scales, and animations that power both design and code.
- **Typography** – Rules for fonts, sizes, and spacing to ensure readability and brand voice.
- **Components** – Reusable interface elements like buttons, forms, and menus.
- **Brand assets** – Logos, imagery, and iconography for consistent marketing and product use.
- **Layout principles** – Guidelines for arranging content in a clear, intuitive way.

By following a Design System, teams can **move faster, collaborate better, and maintain consistency across every brand interaction, whether it's in-app, on the web, or in the real world**.
